        "Matt helped us build a brand new product from scratch. Matt was involved and engaged from the beginning. His (technical) input was extremely valuable for us since not all our product specs were crystal clear at the start. Matt is flexible and fast and thinks broader then just what he is expected to do. Highly recommended for agile development."
