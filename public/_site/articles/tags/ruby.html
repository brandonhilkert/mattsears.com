                    <p>Callbacks are a great technique for achieving simplicity and flexibility. Simply put,
                    a callback is a block of code passed as an argument to a method. In Ruby, code
                    blocks are everywhere and Ruby makes it trivial to pass a block of code to
                    methods. For example:</p><div class="highlight">
                    <pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">block</span><span class="p">)</span>&#x000A;  <span class="n">callback</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">block</span>&#x000A;  <span class="n">callback</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">call</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">)</span>&#x000A;<span class="k">end</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="c1"># =&gt; 25</span></pre>
                    </div><p>But what do we do when a method needs two blocks of code or more? Consider the
                    classic case where we want a method to execute a block of code if an action
                    succeeds or call different code if an action fails.</p><p>In this article, I will demonstrate how we can pass multiple blocks to a method and
                    with some metaprogramming, we can achieve a dynamic callback mechanism with just
                    a few lines of code.</p><p>Let's add a method called <code>callback</code> to the Proc class:</p><div class="highlight">
                    <pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Proc</span>&#x000A;  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">callback</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">callable</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">)</span>&#x000A;    <span class="nb">self</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="no">Class</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span> <span class="k">do</span>&#x000A;      <span class="n">method_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">callable</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_sym</span>&#x000A;      <span class="n">define_method</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">method_name</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|&amp;</span><span class="n">block</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">block</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">nil?</span> <span class="p">?</span> <span class="kp">true</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">block</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">call</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">}</span>&#x000A;      <span class="n">define_method</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">method_name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">?"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="kp">true</span> <span class="p">}</span>&#x000A;      <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">method_missing</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">method_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">block</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="kp">false</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">end</span>&#x000A;    <span class="k">end</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span>&#x000A;  <span class="k">end</span>&#x000A;<span class="k">end</span></pre>
                    </div><p>That's it! The above <code>Proc#callback</code> method simply yields an anonymous class
                    with methods defined to handle our callbacks. This allows for the capability of
                    creating and storing dynamic callbacks, which can later be looked up and
                    executed as needed.</p><p>Notice anything unusual? We're using the <code>===</code> operand to invoke the
                    block. <code>Proc#===</code> is an alias for <code>Proc.call</code>. Anything on the right side of
                    <code>===</code> acts as the proc's parameter. Normally, this is to allow a proc object to
                    be a target of a <code>when</code> clause in case statements, but we're using it as a super
                    simple way of invoking our anonymous class.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s try it with something useful. Let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re writing something which
                    needs to happen in an all-or-nothing, atomic fashion. Either the whole thing
                    works, or none of it does.  A simple case is tweeting:</p><div class="highlight">
                    <pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">tweet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">message</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">block</span><span class="p">)</span>&#x000A;  <span class="no">Twitter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">message</span><span class="p">)</span>&#x000A;  <span class="n">block</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">callback</span> <span class="ss">:success</span>&#x000A;<span class="k">rescue</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">e</span>&#x000A;  <span class="n">block</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">callback</span> <span class="ss">:failure</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">message</span>&#x000A;<span class="k">end</span></pre>
                    </div><p>The <code>tweet</code> method accepts a message string and &amp;block parameters. We call
                    <code>callback</code> on the block and give it a name. Any name will work :success, :error,
                    :fail!, whatever. In addition, we can pass arguments to the blocks (more on that
                    later). Now we can provide a status if the tweet was successful or not:</p><div class="highlight">
                    <pre><span class="n">tweet</span> <span class="s2">"Ruby methods with multiple blocks. #lolruby"</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">on</span><span class="o">|</span>&#x000A;  <span class="n">on</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">success</span> <span class="k">do</span>&#x000A;    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Tweet successful!"</span>&#x000A;  <span class="k">end</span>&#x000A;  <span class="n">on</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">failure</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">status</span><span class="o">|</span>&#x000A;    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Error: </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">status</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>&#x000A;  <span class="k">end</span>&#x000A;<span class="k">end</span></pre>
                    </div><p>The advantage here is that we define our own mini DSL. We don't need to worry
                    about passing too many or unexpected blocks. We could have easily said
                    <code>where.success</code> or <code>on.error</code> or <code>update.fail!</code>. Also note the <code>on.failure</code>
                    block includes a <code>status</code> parameter - this contains the exception message
                    captured in the <code>tweet</code> method above. So if Twitter was down for whatever
                    reason, the <code>on.failure</code> block would be invoked and printed 'Error: Twitter is
                    down or being upgraded'.</p><p>Bonus: In addition to wrapping code in blocks, our <code>Proc#callback</code> method
                    defines boolean style methods. So we could have call the tweet method like this
                    if we wanted to:</p><div class="highlight">
                    <pre><span class="n">tweet</span> <span class="s2">"Ruby methods with multiple blocks. #lolruby"</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">update</span><span class="o">|</span>&#x000A;  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Tweet successful!"</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">update</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">success?</span>&#x000A;  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Sorry, something went wrong."</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">update</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">failure?</span>&#x000A;<span class="k">end</span></pre>
                    </div><p>Put the <code>Proc#callback</code> method in a utility library and your code will look neat and tidy.</p><p>As always, I welcome your thoughts and feedback. Let me know what you think of
                    the techniques shown here, or share your own favorite code block tricks.</p>

                    <p>I watch a lot of tests run in a given day. So I figured why not make it more
                    fun. Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest">minitest</a>'s pride, and um
                    cats? I came up with a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4">Nyan Cat</a>
                    inspired RSpec formatter.</p><p>Update: After last week's launch, Nyan Cat received a great response from the
                    Ruby world. Over the weekend, I released version 0.0.2.  It includes a few bug
                    fixes and some really cool enhancements. Most notably, Nyan Cat now spans
                    multiple lines. In addition, it displays running totals of passing, pending,
                    and failed specs. Thanks to everyone who contributed! Checkout the new
                    screencast below.</p><pre><code>-_-_-_-_-_-_-_,------,&#x000A;_-_-_-_-_-_-_-|   /\_/\&#x000A;-_-_-_-_-_-_-~|__( ^ .^)&#x000A;_-_-_-_-_-_-_-""  ""&#x000A;</code></pre><h2>Nyan Cat</h2><p>Much like <a href="https://github.com/kapoq/nyan">Nyan</a>, Nyan Cat simply creates a rainbow
                    trail of test results. It counts the number of examples as they execute and
                    highlights failed and pending specs. The rainbow changes colors as it runs and
                    if all the specs pass, Nyan Cat falls asleep.  If there are any pending or
                    failing specs, Nyan cat is concerned and can't sleep.</p><p>Here's a short demo of Nyan Cat in action.</p><p></p>

Just install the gem <code>nyan-cat-formatter</code> and simply put the options in your .rspec file:</p><pre><code>--format NyanCatFormatter&#x000A;</code></pre><p>Checkout the code on <a href="https://github.com/mattsears/nyan-cat-formatter">Github</a>
                    and let me know how you like it.  If you run into any issues, please create an
                    issue on Github and I will be sure to get it fixed. Of course you can always

                    was to write the best key/value storage backend you can think of. Since Git is
                    fast, reliable, and a great tool for storing source code, I was really
                    interested in making an easy way to store key/values.</p><p>Built with <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/grit">Grit</a>, Gaga supports SET, GET, KEYS,
                    and DELETE operations. And since it's Git, we can easily enhance it to include
                    other awesome Git features such as branches, diffs, reverting, etc.</p><h2>Usage</h2><div class="highlight">

                    <p>I've just released <a href="https://github.com/mattsears/stamps">Stamps</a> - A Ruby gem for creating postage labels,
                    calculate the shipping cost of packages, standardize domestic
                    addresses via USPS CASS certified Address Matching Software, and track
                    shipments using the Stamps.com Web Services API.</p><h3>Quick Start</h3><p>First, you will need to register for a (free) developer account at
                    <a href="http://developer.stamps.com/developer">Stamps.com</a>. Once you receive
                    your test credentials and integration id, just plug them into the
                    configuration block:</p><div class="highlight">
                    <pre><span class="no">Stamps</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">configure</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">|</span>&#x000A;  <span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">integration_id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXX'</span>&#x000A;  <span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">username</span>       <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'STAMPS USERNAME'</span>&#x000A;  <span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">password</span>       <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'STAMPS PASSWORD'</span>&#x000A;<span class="k">end</span></pre>
                    </div><p>For a simple test, we can call <code>Stamps.account</code> to retreive
                    information about the account.  By default, Stamps will return all
                    responses as a Hash.</p><h3>Create a Stamp</h3><p>First, we need to standardize the shipping address that complies with the USPS address
                    formatting guidelines:</p><div class="highlight">

                    </div><p>Now that we have a clean address we can create a new stamp.  The
                    <code>Stamps.create!</code> takes the sender and receiver address along with parameters

                  <p class='with-border'>
                    <p>Recently, I migrated all of my personal and <a href="http://littlelines.com">business</a> sites
                    to <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>. Heroku, as you may know, is a fantastic
                    service for hosting ruby applications. Oh, and it's free!</p><p>Like a lot of folks, I keep work and personal items such
                    as email, bank accounts, github, etc in separate accounts.
                    Heroku doesn't really place nice with multiple accounts.</p><p>So how to do we effectively manage multiple Heroku accounts?</p><h3>Prerequitites</h3><p>The following assumes you are on the Mac OS or *nix system, own
                    multiple Heroku accounts, and have installed the Heroku gem. I should
                    also be point out that you will need to create separate ssh
                    public keys for each account.</p><h3>Custom Ruby Script</h3><p>One option is we can use a script such as Keith Gaddis
                    <a href="http://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2010/08/06/heroku-ing-with-multiple-personalities">describes</a>
                    over at the Collective Idea blog. With his <a href="https://gist.github.com/511789">switcher</a> script, we can
                    switch between two accounts like this:</p><pre><code>ruby switcher.rb personal&#x000A;ruby switcher.rb work&#x000A;</code></pre><p>This essentially swaps the credentials file (used by the Heroku gem
                    for authentication) for the account you want to
                    use. This works well enough, however this can be tedious especially if
                    you switch between work and personal projects frequently.</p><h3>Enter Heroku Accounts Plugin</h3><p>David Dollar of Heroku recently released an official Heroku
                    plugin called <a href="https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-accounts">heroku-accounts</a>. With
                    this plugin, we can switch Heroku accounts automatically.</p><p>To get started, we first install the plugin:</p><pre><code>heroku plugins:install git://github.com/ddollar/heroku-accounts.git&#x000A;</code></pre><p>The installation process will download the plugin from github and save
                    it to the <code>~/.heroku/plugins</code> directory. Now, we can
                    setup each of our Heroku accounts with <code>add</code> command:</p><pre><code>heroku accounts:add work&#x000A;</code></pre><p>and for our personal account, we can run:</p><pre><code>heroku accounts:add personal&#x000A;</code></pre><p>The <code>add</code> command will ask you for your Heroku email address and
                    password for each account. The plugin will maintain
                    your account credentials in the <code>~/.heroku/accounts</code> folder in your
                    home directory. (Passwords are not saved in plain text)</p><p>To assign a project to a specific Heroku account, we run the following
                    command in the project root:</p><pre><code>heroku accounts:set personal # or work&#x000A;</code></pre><p>This will assign a Heroku account to the project by adding an 'account' variable
                    to the project's git config file.</p><h3>Celebrate</h3><p>Hooray! Now we can switch Heroku accounts automatically. Awesome.</p>

                    <p>At <a href="http://littlelines.com">Littlelines</a>, we have to write a lot of code under strict time constraints. We work in small teams which means that writing clean and concise code is a necessity. When a Ruby library comes along that makes code easier to grasp in a hurry, test, and maintain - we use it. Here are some gems we have in our toolbox:</p><h2><a href="http://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic">Formtastic</a></h2><p>If you're developing wep apps, more than likely it will include html forms.  Forms can be a time-drain, not to mention very boring to build. Formtastic provides a more concise way of generating form views and includes inline error messages and is semantically rich.</p><h2><a href="http://github.com/giraffesoft/resource_controller">Resource  Controller</a></h2><p>Resource Controller hides away the RESTful controller boiler plate code and make your controllers skinny. Skinny controllers help you to consolidate your business logic into one place, thus saves time on maintenance and testing.</p><h2><a href="http://github.com/binarylogic/searchlogic">Search Logic</a></h2><p>Finding data can get messy. Sometimes we run into situations where we are concatenating strings to build SQL statements and this can lead to bugs. Searchlogic works by creating a number of named scopes that can be called on any ActiveRecord model. The best part, you can dynamically call scopes on associated classes and Searchlogic will take care of creating the necessary joins for you.</p><h2><a href="http://github.com/toastyapps/alchemist">Alchemist</a></h2><p>Occasionally, we work on projects dealing with conversions.  Alchemist is a Ruby library that does conversions for you and thus making your code more readable and easier to maintain. For example:</p><p>Instead of:</p><pre><code>miles = 8 * 1609.344 # converting meters to miles&#x000A;</code></pre><p>We can write:</p><pre><code>8.meters.to.miles&#x000A;</code></pre><p>Alchemist includes a staggering array of conversions including distance, mass, volume, and more.</p><h2><a href="http://andand.rubyforge.org/">andand</a></h2><p>andand is a handy gem that allows allows natural method chaining for methods that can return nil. This saves a lot of boilerplate code and improves readability. For example:</p><p>Instead of:</p><pre><code>@body = (article = Article.find_by_title('test')) &amp;&amp; article.body&#x000A;</code></pre><p>We can write this:</p><pre><code>@body = Article.find_by_title('test').andand.body&#x000A;</code></pre><p>This will call find on the Article class and sends 'body' if the result is not nil. In addition, our methods are guarded from NoMethodErrors is the result is nil.</p>

                    <p>Over the last few years, I have grown tired of maintaining, migrating, and upgrading blog software, so I've decided to roll my own with Ruby code. In doing so, I wanted to keep things as simple as possible with a basic set of features: articles, pages, comments, rss, etc. What I didn't want is a SQL database or an administration tool. I wanted to write articles in my text editor of choice (Emacs), in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> format, and versioned with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. So I've ported this site from Mephisto to my own custom creation. I call it Aerial.</p><p>Much inspiration for Aerial has come from <a href="http://github.com/karmi/marley">Marley</a>, a minimal flat-file blog engine written in Sinatra. Like Marley, Aerial is built with <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> and uses plain text files. Unlike Marley, Aerial doesn't use a SQL database and uses <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/grit">Grit</a> to retrieve article and comment files from a Git repository.</p><h2>So how does it work?</h2><p>Articles and comments are stored as plain text files in a local Git directory. Aerial parses each file and converts them the Article and Comment objects with their own set of attributes such as title, body, tags, and author. For example, this article looks something like this:</p><pre><code>Title      : Git blogging with Aerial&#x000A;Tags       : projects, ruby, git, sinatra&#x000A;Published  : 03/28/2009&#x000A;Author     : Matt Sears&#x000A;&#x000A;Over the last few years...&#x000A;</code></pre><p>Since Aerial reads the articles from the Git repository, the contents of article won't display in the browser unless the changes are committed to Git. Same goes for comments.</p><h2>Working with remote repositories</h2><p>Aerial uses local and remote Git repositories to sync data between the production web server and your local environment. For example, when comments are submitted on the production web server, they are checked for Spam via <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> and saved to the same directory as the article. Then, the new comment file is added to the production web server's repository and pushed to the remote repository (Github in my case). To pull in user comments to our local environment, simply use the pull command:</p><pre><code>git pull&#x000A;</code></pre><p>Now we have all the comments that users have submitted.</p><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>For Aerial to work, you'll need Git installed and the following RubyGems:</p><pre><code>sudo gem install sinatra grit rdiscount haml&#x000A;</code></pre><p>Grab the <a href="http://github.com/mattsears/aerial">source code</a> from Github.</p><p>A small configuration file in config/config.yml is used to store information about your blog. You can add your info now or leave it as is and it will still work. To setup and run Aerial, we need to run the boostrap Rake task:</p><pre><code>rake bootstrap&#x000A;</code></pre><p>This will install the necessary directories (specified in the config.yml file), javascript files, and insert a sample article to get you started. If every goes smoothly, Aerial should be up and running at:</p><pre><code>http://localhost:4567&#x000A;</code></pre><p>Keeping in spirit with minimalism, all the pages use <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com">Haml</a> for the templating engine. Of course, you may change this to the templating engine of your choice.</p><h2>Creating new articles</h2><p>Create a new folder in the app/articles directory.  You can name this folder anything you want, but it may be helpful to number them so they display in the order you want them to. For example, the folder for this articles looks like this:</p><pre><code>app/articles/011-introducing-aerial&#x000A;</code></pre><p>Next, create a text file with the extension '.article' and save it to the new folder.  The '.article' file extension let's Aerial know that this file should be converted to an Article object.  The name of the article will be the article's permalink. Remember, the article will not display on the site until it's committed to the git repository. When the article is completed, we can push it to the remote repository with the push command:</p><pre><code>git push&#x000A;</code></pre><p>Now, we're ready to deploy it.</p><h2>Deployment</h2><p>Deployment tasks are handled with <a href="http://rubyhitsquad.com/Vlad_the_Deployer.html">Vlad the Deployer</a>. A simple deployment script is located at config/deploy.rb. It assumes your running Apache and Phusions Passenger, but you can edit this file with your own settings. Future enhancements may include auto-syncing with post-receive hooks so that 'git push' will make Aerial update itself, but for now we can deploy with a simple rake task:</p><pre><code>rake deploy&#x000A;</code></pre><p>This is by no means a comprehensive introduction.

                    <p>Update: I thought I should give a little background on how I got started with Rails - when I was attending the SDWest conference in March 2006.  I was at the Jolt Awards, and saw @d2h receive the award for the best web development tool for Rails 1.0.  I downloaded Rails that night in the hotel room and was hooked.</p><p>This week marks the two year anniversary when I delivered my first professional Rails app.  Today, I decided to take a look back at the  code of that first project and see what's improved over the past two years.  The result - not bad, but there were a couple areas that stood out. Here are a few:</p><ol>
                    <li>The controllers in that first project were out of control. Not sure why, maybe coming from the J2EE world, my first instinct was to cram everything into the controller. It was apparent that the concept of REST wasn't completely baked into my brain yet. Not to mention the concept of fat models, skinny controllers.</li>
                    <li>Second, the views and Javascripts were a bit unorganized.  I noticed excessive conditional logic and messy Javascript code in a few of the pages.  If I was to re-write the app today, most of it could be cleanup with rendering partials with collections and using Low Pro to clean up the Javascript.</li>
                    <li>Finally, the sheer lack of plugins for that first project was surprising. It's true that the amount and quality of plugins have grown in two years, but I believe the lack of awareness was the main cause.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>So this made me think of what I would say if I were to advise newcomers writing their first Rails app.  I would have to say first, if you find yourself writing code in the controller, then ask yourself "Can I put this logic in the model?". And also be sure to familiarize yourself with the available plugins with sites such as <a href="http://agilewebdevelopment.com">Agile Web Development</a> and <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>. They can save you a ton of work.</p>

                    <p>This month I headed down to Orlando, Florida for RubyConf 2008. It kicked off with a delightful (and touching) keynote by Matz. He walked through his own programming history with languages including the language he got started with BASIC (the same language I started with). Matz talked about the growing community and a statistic from Gartner that says there are over a million Ruby developers and will grow to 4 million by 2012, which is amazing. He finished up by saying that Ruby is all about love, and included a slide that said "I love you all".  Below are couple highlights from each day.</p><blockquote>

                    </blockquote><h2>Day 1:</h2><p>Gregg Pollack's talk on Scaling Ruby (without Rails) was really good.  He touched on green and native threads, EventMachine, message queues, and profiling code with ruby-prof.  My favorite part of the presentation was the performance tips and tricks of optimizing Ruby code.  His talk is up at EnvyCast and I definitely recommend it.</p><p>Jamis Buck - "Recovering from the Enterprise" was probably my favorite presentation at the conference.  The main theme of his talk was that working in the enterprise solves problems differently than those solutions in Ruby.  Jamis worked in Java (like me) before Ruby and he told a story of how he written a library for dependency injection for Ruby but realized that he was trying to use Java solutions in a Ruby world that didn't need it. He said Java is like Legos and Ruby is like Play-doh and delivered the best quote of the conference "Just in time, not just in case"</p><blockquote>

                    </blockquote><h2>Day 2:</h2><p>Effective and Creative Code by Eric Ivancich was awesome.  He discussed how our minds work while programming - the differences between fascination and direct attention, the mental fatique and long periods of direct attention can have on you.  Fascinating stuff.</p><p>Yehuda Katz taught us how to write code that doesn't suck with Interface Oriented Design.  But first, he announced that Merb 1.0 was released just minutes before his presentation.  Then he went on to say that unit tests are not regression tests and that writing regression tests should make sure that the API we are exposing to the world doesn't break while work is being done under the covers.</p><blockquote>

                    </blockquote><h2>Day 3:</h2><p>I saw Neal Ford's talk on Advanced DSLs in Ruby - one of my favorite topics.  This presentation was really good because Neal was very specific on how to build DSLs in Ruby and not just the basics.  He covered various techniques on writing DSLs and provided a nice summary of his talk on his <a href="http://www.nealford.com/downloads/conferences/canonical/Neal_Ford-Advanced_DSLs_in_Ruby-slides.pdf">website</a>.</p><p>I sat down next to Dave Thomas to listen to Gregory Brown's talk about Prawn, a pure Ruby PDF generation library. Prawn is cool, but how Prawn was born was the most interesting part of the talk. A community funded project called The Ruby Mendicant Project allowed Gregory to quit his job and work on Prawn full time - A Ruby community employee.</p><p>Overall it was an amazing conference.  It was great to see and talk to people that I only get to see online.  Looking forward to next year.</p>

                    <p>Last week I made a short drive to Columbus for the erubycon conference presented by the <a href="http://theedgecase.com">EdgeCase</a> crew.  The three day conference, hosted by Microsoft, was an event to demonstrate Ruby's role in the enterprise.  Having worked in the Enterprise for six years, I was very excited to learn more about how Ruby can change the Enterprise.</p><blockquote>

                    </blockquote><p>What is legacy code and how do we avoid it?  Stuart Halloway addresses these questions with his talk <a href="http://blog.thinkrelevance.com/2008/4/1/ending-legacy-code-in-our-lifetime">Ending Legacy Code In Our Lifetime</a>.  This was my favorite talk on the first day because the Enterprise is "full of it" and much my time was spent trying to avoid it. It's nice to see somebody calling attention to it.</p><blockquote>

                    </blockquote><p>Very interesting talk on JRuby by it's creator Charles Nutter on the second day.  I went back to the hotel room that evening and setup JRuby on my laptop.  I wrote a quick rails app and with <a href="http://caldersphere.rubyforge.org/warbler/">Warbler</a>, had a working war file ready to be deployed to Java application server.  Very impressive.</p><blockquote>

                    </blockquote><p>Perhaps my favorite session at the conference was Jim Weirich's talk on concurrent software development. Something I don't think is talked about enough and is certainly important in the Enterprise.  I've written multi-threaded apps in Java and it can be very difficult especially avoiding deadlocks.  Is Ruby the answer? According to Jim, not really. Perhaps a Erlang or Clojure offers a better solution.</p><blockquote>

                    <p>Just finished making some major changes to this site.  First thing you might noticed are the changes to the design. In effort to simplify things a bit, I modified a <a href="http://www.quotedprintable.com/pages/scribbish">Scribbish</a> theme to my own liking.  Is it too geeky? The awesome portrait you see at the top right was created by <a href="http://papertelevision.com" title="Paper Television">Josh</a>.  Nailed it.</p><p>Here is a rundown of the changes made:</p><ol>
                    <li>Upgraded to Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron</li>
                    <li>Installed Apache and Phusion Passenger (mod_rails)</li>
                    <li>Change and tweaked Mephisto theme</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>I'm still in the process of moving my old blog posts over. More big news coming soon.</p>
