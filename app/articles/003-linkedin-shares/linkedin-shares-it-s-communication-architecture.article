I was just reading LinkedIn's presentation on it's architecture and it was like walking down memory lane. I worked with almost the same architecture at [LexisNexis](http://www.lexisnexis.com). We also used Java, Solaris, Tomcat (Websphere mostly), Oracle, JMS and the cached was implemented with C++. Ah, the good ol' days.
