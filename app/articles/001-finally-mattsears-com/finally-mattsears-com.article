After a decade of waiting, I finally nabbed the mattsears.com domain name. I almost forgot about it until Godaddy sent me an email last week that said it was Pending deletion. Though, I have to admit that I'm not really excite about it as I thought I would be. I guess it's because I've been using matthewsears.com for a couple years now and excepted using my full name instead, but it's cool that I have both now.
